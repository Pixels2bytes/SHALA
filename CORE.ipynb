        "This is a Python-based chatbot project powered by the Gemma 3 AI Agent, designed to assist individuals experiencing depression by providing ongoing emotional check-ins and real-time crisis intervention. Mental health support systems must be developed and used with sensitivity, responsibility, and respect for the lives they aim to protect. SHALA is not a replacement for certified therapists or mental health professionals. This project is intended for research, prototype development, and educational purposes only. Any misuse of this software that results in the abuse of real emergency lines is strictly prohibited. Developers and users must ensure that real hotline numbers are never used in any version of this program outside of an officially approved deployment with proper oversight and consent. **During development, all outgoing call features were pointed to a non-functioning test number.**"
